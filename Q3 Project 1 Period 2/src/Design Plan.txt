Week 1:

- Create valid maps for easy, medium, and hard difficulties, and 
make sure that I can push to Github properly

- Also program methods to read a map and store the values in an 
array

- Begin working on the queue-based approach for finding the solution to the 
map
- Try to have this done by the end of the week (before week 2)

Week 2:

- Work on stack-based approach and finish this before the middle of the week

- Begin thinking about how to optimize the pathfinding, and look into 
prominent search algorithms (i.e. A*) and extract the main ideas from them
to program my own algorithm

- Start optimizing pathfinding, and stress test both the queue-based and stack-based
approaches to see if they fail in any scenario

Week 3

- Finish optimization of pathfinding and continue bugtesting

- implement exceptions for maps and command line arguments

- submit assignment before 3/22 at 11:59 pm
